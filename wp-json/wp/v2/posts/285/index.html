Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against all with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.\u00a0The world&#8217;s most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We give special attention to your intellectual development.
