Its capital cityis Zagreb, which forms one of the country&#8217;s primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers 56,594 square kilometres and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia&#8217;s Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country&#8217;s population is 4.28\u00a0million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism.\u00a0Croatia can be subdivided between a number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia\u2014Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-276\" src=\"http:\/\/rarathemesdemo.com\/education-zone\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/25\/2016\/11\/chef-939437_1280-300x235.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/chef-939437_1280-300x235.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/chef-939437_1280-768x602.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/chef-939437_1280.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>The Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. Tomislav became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom. The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Peter Kre\u0161imir IV and Dmitar Zvonimir. Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne. In 1918, after World War I, Croatia was included in the unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which seceded from Austria-Hungary and merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Independent State of Croatia backed by the fascist Italy and Germany existed during World War II. After the war, Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a constitutionally socialist state.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-181 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/rarathemesdemo.com\/education-zone\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/25\/2016\/11\/surfing-1622182_1280-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/surfing-1622182_1280-300x199.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/surfing-1622182_1280-768x510.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/surfing-1622182_1280.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>A unitary state, Croatia is a republic governed under a parliamentary system.

Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the summer, with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia&#8217;s most important trading partner. The Croatian government constantly invests in infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the Pan-European corridors. Internal sources produce a significant portion of energy in Croatia; the rest is imported. Croatia provides a universal health care system and free primary and secondary education, while supporting culture through numerous public institutions and corporate investments in media and publishing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Croatia\u00a0is a sovereign state at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean.
