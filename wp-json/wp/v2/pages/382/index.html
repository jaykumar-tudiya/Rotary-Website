It is a secular organization open to all persons regardless of race, color, creed or political preference. There are more than 33,000 clubs and over 1.2 million members world-wide. The members of Rotary Clubs are known as Rotarians. The stated purpose of the organization is to bring together business and professional leaders to provide humanitarian service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. Members usually meet weekly for breakfast, lunch or dinner, which is a social event as well as an opportunity to organize work on their service goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rotary&#8217;s best-known motto is&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Service above Self&#8221;<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Rotary Foundation<\/strong>&nbsp;is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the efforts of Rotary International to achieve world understanding and peace through international humanitarian, educational, and cultural exchange programs. It is supported solely by voluntary contributions from Rotarians and friends of the Foundation who share its vision of a better world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/about.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-615\" width=\"205\" height=\"124\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Foundation was created in&nbsp;<strong>1917<\/strong>&nbsp;by Rotary International&#8217;s sixth president, Arch C. Klumph, as an endowment fund for Rotary &#8220;<strong>to do good in the world.<\/strong>&#8221; It has grown from an initial contribution of US$26.50 only to more than US$55 million.&nbsp;It is one of the largest and most prestigious international fellowship programs in the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The mission<\/strong>&nbsp;of The&nbsp;<strong>Rotary Foundation<\/strong>&nbsp;is to enable Rotarians to advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace through the improvement of health, the support of education, and the alleviation of poverty.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-heading su-heading-style-default su-heading-align-center\" id=\"\" style=\"font-size:25px;margin-bottom:40px\"><div class=\"su-heading-inner\"><div class=\"su-animate\" style=\"visibility:hidden;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-delay:0s;animation-duration:1s;animation-delay:0s;\" data-animation=\"bounce\" data-duration=\"1\" data-delay=\"0\">ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to carry out its service programs, Rotary is structured in club, district and international levels. Rotarians are members of their clubs. The clubs are chartered by the global organization Rotary International (RI) headquartered in Evanston, a suburb of Chicago. For administration purposes, the more than 33,000 clubs worldwide are grouped into 529 districts, and the districts into 34 zones.<br><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-service\"><div class=\"su-service-title\" style=\"padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px\"><i class=\"sui sui-bookmark-o\" style=\"font-size:32px;color:#333\"><\/i> CLUB LEVEL<\/div><div class=\"su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\" style=\"padding-left:46px\">Each club elects its own president and officers among its active members for a one year term. The clubs enjoy considerable autonomy within the framework of the standard constitution and the constitution and bylaws of Rotary International. The governing body of the club is the board of directors, which consists of president-elect, vice president, club secretary and treasurer, chaired by club president. The immediate past president is a de facto member of the board. The club president appoints the chairmen of the four main task groups for club service, vocational service, community service and international service.<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-service\"><div class=\"su-service-title\" style=\"padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px\"><i class=\"sui sui-bookmark-o\" style=\"font-size:32px;color:#333\"><\/i> District level<\/div><div class=\"su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\" style=\"padding-left:46px\">A district governor, who is an officer of Rotary International and represents the RI board of directors in the field, leads Rotary districts. The governor is nominated by the clubs of the district and elected by all the clubs meeting in the annual RI Convention held in a different country each year. To assist him with his duties, the district governor appoints assistant governors from among the Rotarians of the district.<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-service\"><div class=\"su-service-title\" style=\"padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px\"><i class=\"sui sui-bookmark-o\" style=\"font-size:32px;color:#333\"><\/i> Zone level <\/div><div class=\"su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\" style=\"padding-left:46px\">Approximately 15 Rotary districts form a zone. A zone director, who serves as a member of the RI board of directors, heads two zones. The zone director is nominated by the clubs in the zone and elected by the convention for the terms of two consecutive years.<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-service\"><div class=\"su-service-title\" style=\"padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px\"><i class=\"sui sui-bookmark-o\" style=\"font-size:32px;color:#333\"><\/i> Rotary International <\/div><div class=\"su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\" style=\"padding-left:46px\">Rotary International is governed by a board of directors composed of 17 zone directors, a president-elect and an international president. The nomination and the election of the president are based on zones. The international president, the highest officer of the organization, is elected for a term of one year. The board meets quarterly to establish policies.<\/p>\n<p>The chief administrative officer of RI is the general secretary, who heads a staff of about 600 persons working at the headquarters and in seven international offices around the world.<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-heading su-heading-style-default su-heading-align-center\" id=\"\" style=\"font-size:28px;margin-bottom:40px\"><div class=\"su-heading-inner\"><div class=\"su-animate\" style=\"visibility:hidden;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-delay:0s;animation-duration:1s;animation-delay:0s;\" data-animation=\"bounce\" data-duration=\"1\" data-delay=\"0\">MEMBERSHIP <\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rotary defines itself as a non-partisan, non-sectarian and secular organization. It is open to business and professional leaders of all ages (18 and upwards) and economic status. A cross section of its membership would suggest a tendency towards the middle-aged and wealthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One can contact a Rotary club to enquire about membership but can join a rotary club only if invited; there is no provision to join without an invitation as each prospective Rotarian requires a sponsor who is an existing Rotarian. The clubs have some exclusivist membership criteria: reputation and business or professional leadership is a specific evaluation criterion for issuing invitations to join, and they limit representation from a specific profession or business to a percentage of a specific club&#8217;s membership.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-service\"><div class=\"su-service-title\" style=\"padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px\"><i class=\"sui sui-user\" style=\"font-size:32px;color:#333\"><\/i> Active membership <\/div><div class=\"su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\" style=\"padding-left:46px\">Active membership is by invitation from a current Rotarian, to professionals or businesspersons working in diverse areas of endeavor. Each club can have up to ten per cent of its membership representing each business or profession in the area it serves. The goal of the clubs is to promote service to the community they work in, as well as to the wider world. Many projects are organized for the local community by a single club, but some are organized globally.<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-service\"><div class=\"su-service-title\" style=\"padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px\"><i class=\"sui sui-user\" style=\"font-size:32px;color:#333\"><\/i> Honorary membership <\/div><div class=\"su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\" style=\"padding-left:46px\">Honorary membership is given by election of a Rotary Club to people who have distinguished themselves by meritorious service in the furtherance of Rotary ideals. Honorary membership is conferred only in exceptional cases. Honorary members are exempt from the payment of admission fees and dues. They have no voting privileges and are not eligible to hold any office in their club. Honorary membership is time limited and terminates automatically at the end of the term, usually one year. It may be extended for an additional period or may also be revoked at any time. Examples of honorary members are heads of state or former heads of state, famous scientists or other famous people<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"su-heading su-heading-style-default su-heading-align-center\" id=\"\" style=\"font-size:28px;margin-bottom:40px\"><div class=\"su-heading-inner\"><div class=\"su-animate\" style=\"visibility:hidden;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-delay:0s;animation-duration:1s;animation-delay:0s;\" data-animation=\"bounce\" data-duration=\"1\" data-delay=\"0\">STATISTICS <\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The family of Rotary extends beyond individual Rotarians and Rotary clubs to include other service-minded people who help with the organization&#8217;s work.
