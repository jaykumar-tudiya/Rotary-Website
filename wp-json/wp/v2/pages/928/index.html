Benefits of Joining Rotary?<\/div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\"><strong>Friendship:<\/strong> In an increasingly complex world, Rotary provides one of the most basic human needs: the need for friendship and fellowship. It is one of two reasons why Rotary began in 1905.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Business Development:<\/strong> The second original reason for Rotary`s beginning is business development. Everyone needs to network. Rotary consists of a cross section of every business community. Its members come from all walks of life. Rotarians help each other and collectively help others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personal Growth and Development:<\/strong> Membership in Rotary continues one&#8217;s growth and education in human relations and personal development. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leadership Development:<\/strong> Rotary is an organization of leaders and successful people. Serving in Rotary positions is like a college education. Leadership: &#8211; learning how to motivate, influence, and lead leaders. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Citizenship in the Community:<\/strong> Membership in a Rotary club makes one a better community citizen. The average Rotary club consists of the most active citizens of any community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Continuing Education:<\/strong> Each week at Rotary there is a program designed to keep one informed about what is going on in the community, nation, and world. Each meeting provides an opportunity to listen to different speakers and a variety of timely topics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fun:<\/strong> Rotary is fun, a lot of fun. Each meeting is fun. The club projects are fun. Social activities are fun. The service is fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Public Speaking Skills:<\/strong> Many individuals who joined Rotary were afraid to speak in public. Rotary develops confidence and skill in public communication and the opportunity to practice and perfect these skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Citizenship in the World:<\/strong> Every Rotarian wears a pin that says &#8220;Rotary International.&#8221; There are few places on the globe that do not have a Rotary club. Every Rotarian is welcome &#8211; even encouraged &#8211; to attend any of the over 32,000 clubs in 168 nations and geographical regions. This means instant friends in both one&#8217;s own community and in the world community. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Assistance when Traveling:<\/strong> Because there are Rotary clubs everywhere, many a Rotarian in need of a doctor, lawyer, hotel, dentist, advice, etc., while traveling has found assistance through Rotary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Entertainment:<\/strong> Every Rotary club and district has parties and activities that provide diversion in one&#8217;s business life. Rotary holds conferences, conventions, assemblies, and institutes that provide entertainment in addition to Rotary information, education, and service. <\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-default su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"><\/span>2.
